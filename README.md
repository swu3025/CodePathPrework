## Hello World App

### App Description
This app is an introduction to creating an IOS app. Inside this app, the user is greeted with a message from the creator and contains four functions. First, the user can change the text label on the app by inputing a custom text in the text field provided and then clicking on the "Change Text" button. If the user does not input any text and clicks on the "Change Text" button, then the text in the label will display "Goodbye ðŸ‘‹". The button "Change Text Color" has the functionality of changing the color of the label text with a ROYGBIV color when the selected color is inputed into the text field. If there is no input in the text field, the text color will be set to a color selected by the creator. Clicking on the "Change View Color" will change the background of the app to a ROYGBIV color if the user inserts a color into the text field, otherwise, the background color will be set to a color selected by the creator. Finally, the user is able to revert everything back to the default settings by tapping anywhere on the background view.
